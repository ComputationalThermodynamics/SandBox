## Gibbs free energy minimization

> #### *MAGEMin_PGE_and_LP.m*
>
> - MATLAB script used in Riel et al., 2022 (in review) to present a simplified application of MAGEMin minimization approach (including feldspar, quartz and sillimanite) and compare it with linear programming. 
> - The minimization is conducted in the NCKAS chemical system at 0.3 GPa and 873.15 K.
> - The Plagioclase model is taken after Holland et al., 2021
> - The Linear programming approach described in de Capitani & Brown (1987)
