> MAGEMin_PGE_and_LP.m
	 - This MATLAB script is used in Riel et al., 2022 (in review) to present a simplified application of MAGEMin minimization approach (including feldspar, qurtz and sillimanite)and compare it with linear programming. 
	 - The Plagioclase model is taken after Holland et al., 2021
	 - The Linear programming approach described in de Capitani & Brown (1987)
