# Thermodynamic Sandbox

Here you can find script(s) dealing with thermodynamic-related problems

## Nullspace minimizer

> #### *NullspaceMinimization/nullMin.jl*
>
> - Julia scripts to use nullspace optimization approach to minimize individual site-fraction based solution phases.
> - The scripts include spinel, clinopyroxene and amphibole as formulated in Holland et al., 2018.
> - Gibbs hyperplane for each phase have been computed using MAGEMin and the igneous database.

	1. 12 kbar and 1100 째C for spinel
	2. 3.26 kbar and 906.25 째C for the spinel solvus test
	2. 12 kbar and 1100 째C for clinopyroxene
	3. 5 kbar and 650 째C for amphibole


## Gibbs free energy minimization

> #### *PhaseEquilibriumMinimizer/MAGEMin_PGE_and_LP.m*
>
> - MATLAB script used in Riel et al., (2022) [Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 23, 7] to present a simplified application of MAGEMin minimization approach (including feldspar, quartz and sillimanite) and compare it with linear programming. 
> - The minimization is conducted in the NCKAS chemical system at 0.3 GPa and 873.15 K.
> - The Plagioclase model is taken after Holland et al., 2021
> - The Linear programming approach described in de Capitani & Brown (1987)
